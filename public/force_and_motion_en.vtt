Force and motion.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8868

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.260
In this activity, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8868

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.207
students will use three different sized marbles to demonstrate how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8868

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:16.880
a greater force applied will move a Cup further.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8766

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.500
For this explore activity, students will need the following materials.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8717

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.187
Preparation. Flip the Cup upside down and cut 1/2 circle

NOTE Confidence: 0.8717

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.460
opening at the bottom of each Cup.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8701

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.406
Each group will set up a ramp with the Cup

NOTE Confidence: 0.8701

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:36.160
upside down on the ramp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8751

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.582
The Cup should be positioned at the lowest end of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8751

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:40.280
the ramp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8625

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.442
Students will then predict in their Journal which marble will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8625

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.189
move the Cup the longest distance and which one they

NOTE Confidence: 0.8625

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.900
think will move it the shortest.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8541

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.780
Groups will take turns placing each marble at the highest

NOTE Confidence: 0.8541

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:56.110
point of the ramp and releasing it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8572

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.089
They will then place a sticker on the spot where

NOTE Confidence: 0.8572

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.020
the Cup moved.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8572

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.130
They will then measure the distance moved,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8572

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.750
making sure to use a different color dot each time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.016
For differentiation, students can measure the distance in centimeters with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:11.630
a ruler or with paperclips.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.090
Repeat this process with each sized marble.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8624

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.907
Using their student journals, students will record the distance moved

NOTE Confidence: 0.8624

00:01:18.963 --> 00:01:21.950
and sketch what happened to each of the three marbles.
